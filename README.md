# Quiz
This is my fully functional Quiz web interface. It consists of HTML file which is essential for structure, CSS file for design and JS file for functionality.

In this project first you have to click the "start" button.
5 questions will come one after another.
Answer accordingly and see the result.
You can try another round by clicking the "restart" button and same questions will appear in same order.

Logic is simple if you open and look at the JS file.

Let me know if you like the design and experience.
