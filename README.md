# Quiz
This is my fully functional Quiz web interface. It consists of HTML file which is essential for structure, CSS file for design and JS file for functionality.

In this project first you have to click the "start" button.
5 questions will come one after another.
Answer accordingly and see the result.
You can try another round by clicking the "restart" button and same questions will appear in same order.

Logic is simple if you open and look at the JS file.

Let me know if you like the design and experience.

# Assignment 1

This Project had an assignment that when an user clicks the correct option, it will glow green.
And when the user clicks the incorrect option, it will glow red and correct option will be highlighted as well.

If you think that the option glows because you clicked an option, you are right.
But if you think you clicked the wrong option and the correct option glows and you'll click the correct one to get 100% score then you are wrong.
After clicking an option, the cursor will be unable to click the option untill and unless you click the next button.

# Assignment 2

This Project had an assignment that next button is not necessary for moving to next question.
It will take 5 seconds but in order to get your attention, I made a progress bar too.
